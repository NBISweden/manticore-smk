        Barcode sequence identifying the sample or library. This value
        is the expected barcode bases as read by the sequencing
        machine in the absence of errors. If there are several
        barcodes for the sample/library (e.g., one on each end of the
        template), the recommended implementation concatenates all the
        barcodes separating them with hyphens (-)
